Hi, I'm Jungwon! I create technologies that is user-centered, context-aware, and value-sensitive to better serve marginalized communities.


I am currently working as Chief Marketing Officer at Quus, a blockchain-based startup company that aims to decentralize the current ecosystem for small businesses, Sanggatalk, and independent writers. I earned my Master's in Engineering - Computer Science Cornell Tech in 2021 and Bachelor's in Science, majoring in Information Science and minoring in Business.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
